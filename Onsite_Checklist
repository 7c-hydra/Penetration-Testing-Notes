This is my on-site delivery/consulting checklist:

[ ] Point of contact name, work hours, and phone number
[ ] Back-up point of contact name, work hours, and phone number
[ ] Physical copy of statement of work, authorization form, and any details regarding the work relevant to its completion

[ ] Details for on-site arrival; 
    [] Physical Address
    [] Parking Details
    [] Building Entry Requirements (check-in log, ID requirements, etc.)
    [] Reporting Office Number (if not in the lobby) 

[ ] Work laptop
[ ] Ethernet Cable
[ ] Thumb or External Hard Drive
[ ] Physical Paper and Pens
[ ] Headphones

[ ] Ask about access to food and water. If there are none, bring lunch and waters.
